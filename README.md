To open the todo app, right-click (Windows) or double-click (Mac) the index.html file and select "Open with" from the action menu. Open the file using Google Chrome.

Users can see the dates and times that are offered and check the "Yes" box if they are available or "Yes, if needed" if they could possibly be available as the last resort. After pressing the submit button, the user can see the times they indicated at the bottom.

Key characteristics that differentiate Doodle from When2meet is that Doodle has clicking checkbox options while When2meet is click and drag on a grid. Our implementation succesfully does that by letting users check whether they are available (options of yes or yes, if needed) and then showing confirmation on the bottom that the form was completed.
